/* Specifications:
 * The name serverâ€™s function is to manage the vending-machine names. The name server is passed the number
 * of vending machines, NumVendingMachines, and the number of students, NumStudents. It begins by logically
 * distributing the students evenly across the vending machines in a round-robin fashion. That is, student id 0
 * is assigned to the first registered vending-machine, student id 1 is assigned to the second registered vending-
 * machine, etc., until there are no more registered vending-machines, and then start again with the first registered
 * vending-machine. Vending machines call VMregister to register themselves so students can subsequently locate
 * them. A student calls getMachine to find a vending machine, and the name server must cycle through the
 * vending machines separately for each student starting from the initial position via modulo incrementing to
 * ensure a student has a chance to visit every machine. The truck calls getMachineList to obtain an array of
 * pointers to vending machines so it can visit each machine to deliver new soda.
 *
 * The name server prints the following information:
 * 
 * State    Meaning                     Additional Information
 * -----    -------                     ----------------------
 * S        starting
 * R        register vending machine    identifier of registering vending machine
 * N        new vending machine         student requesting vending machine, new vending machine
 * F        finished
