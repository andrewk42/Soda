Dec 4 5:50pm: Most inital design is complete, beginning to think about testing...
-------------
-Pointers: Want to avoid null pointer errors
    -> Couple all non-task deletions with := NULL
        + not done in uMain::main since these pointers are not reused
        + done in Student::main when deleting a WATCard
        + done in Courier::main when deleting a Job
        + not done within object destructors since these pointers are not reused
    -> perform assert( != NULL) before all pointer references
        + done in Student::main when obtaining vending machines
        + done in WATCardOffice::main when referencing the next queued Job*
        + done in WATCardOffice::requestWork when retrieving the next queued Job*
        + done in Courier::main when referencing the returned Job*
        + done in NameServer::VMRegister before registering a VendingMachine*
        + done in Truck::main when retrieving the machine list
        + done in Truck::main when retrieving a machine's inventory

-Memory Management: Want to avoid memory leaks
    -> Check if runtime errors?

-Printer tests
