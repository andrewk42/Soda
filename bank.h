/* Specifications:
 * The Bank is a monitor, which behaves like a server, that manages student-account information for all students.
 * Each studentâ€™s account initially starts with a balance of $0. The parent calls deposit to endow gifts to a specific
 * student. A courier calls withdraw to transfer money on behalf of the WATCard office for a specific student. The
 * courier waits until enough money has been deposited, which may require multiple deposits.
