/* Specifications:
 * The WATCard manages the money associated with a card. When a WATCard is created it has a $0 balance.
 * The courier calls deposit after a funds transfer. A vending machine calls withdraw when a soda is purchased.
 * A student and a vending machine call getBalance to determine the balance. FWATCard is a future pointer to a
 * studentâ€™s WATCard for synchronizing access to the WATCard between the student and the courier.
